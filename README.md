## Project Overview

The **Iris Flower Prediction** project is a classic machine learning problem that aims to predict the species of iris flowers based on their features. This implementation utilizes a Flask API for deployment, allowing users to interact with the model through a web interface. The project serves as an excellent introduction to machine learning and web development integration.

## Features

- Predicts the species of iris flowers using various features such as sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
- Deployed using Flask API for easy access and interaction.
- User-friendly interface for inputting flower measurements.
- Comprehensive model evaluation and performance metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Web Framework**: Flask
- **Machine Learning Libraries**: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn (optional for visualizing data)
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE
- **Version Control**: Git

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the **Iris dataset**, which contains 150 samples of iris flowers from three species: **Setosa**, **Versicolor**, and **Virginica**. Each sample includes four features:

- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width

The dataset can be found in the `data` folder of this repository or downloaded from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris).

## Installation and Setup

To set up the Iris Flower Prediction project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/palpratik56/IrisFlower-prediction.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd IrisFlower-prediction
    ```

3. **Install required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download any necessary datasets**: Ensure that the Iris dataset is available in the `data` folder as specified in the project files.

## Usage

To run the Flask API:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Start the Flask server using the following command:
    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the API.
4. Input the sepal and petal measurements to receive species predictions.
